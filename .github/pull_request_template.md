# Rationale for this change

<!--
 Why are you proposing this change? If this is already explained clearly in the linked issue then this section is not needed.
 Explaining clearly why changes are proposed helps reviewers understand your changes and offer better suggestions for fixes.

 Example:
 Add `NestedLoopJoinExec`.
 Closes #345.

 Since we added `HashJoinExec` in #323 it has been possible to do provable inner joins. However performance is not satisfactory in some cases. Hence we need to fix the problem by implement `NestedLoopJoinExec` and speed up the code
 for `HashJoinExec`.
